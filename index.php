          <p>I graduated from an iOS bootcamp at TurnToTech in 2014, and became proficient in iOS dev, Objectve-C, XCode and OOP. I'm also self-taught in Java, Rails, JavaScript and CSS. I have a working knowledge of Git, Swift, jQuery and SQL from past projects. My next learning goal is to become an expert in both iOS and Android. </p>
          <p>I graduated with a BSBA and a minor in Japanese from UNC - Chapel Hill in 2011. </p>

      <p>After working in marketing and sales, and performing stand-up comedy for 2-3 years, I made the commitment to pursue programming as a career in early 2014. I was inspired by what I saw in the tech world and wanted to learn this new skill that could help impact the world through innovation. After intense studying throughout 2014, I became a full-time programmer. </p>

      <p>The internet has changed the way we learn, but I think we can make it even better. I want to help create better accessibility to free knowledge and information for people all over the world. I also am deeply curious about the future of tech entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>In the short term, I want to keep growing and developing my skills at a place where I can make an impact. </p>
